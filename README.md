# Deliveries
Building a culture-specific (& generic) delivery services for our hometown.

Quick Setup:

How to run on your local machine:
You need to create a virtual environment in your project directory:
Instead of installing on your own machine, install in a Python's virtual env, by
cd-ing to a directory to make a virtual env, and: python3 -m venv your-new-venv-name.

Activate the virtual environment by performing the following command:

Inside your project directory
On Windows: your-venv-folder\Scripts\activate.bat
On Unix/MacOS: source your-venv-folder/bin/activate 

Next, use the requirements file located in the repo:

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
