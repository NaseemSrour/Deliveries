<h2>Quick Setup:</h2>

How to run on your local machine:<br>
You need to create a virtual environment (venv) in your project directory, so instead of installing on your own machine, install in a Python's virtual env, by
cd-ing to a directory to make a virtual env, and:<br>

> python -m venv your-new-venv-name.

Activate the virtual environment by performing the following command inside your project directory:<br>

On Windows:<br>
> your-venv-folder\Scripts\activate.bat <br><br>

On Unix/MacOS: <br>
> source your-venv-folder/bin/activate 

Next, use the requirements file located in the repo, while the venv is activated, and:

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
