"""
Fixtures are a pytest construct that can be used to encapsulate repeating functionality that can be shared across tests.

You define a fixture, that usually returns/yields some sort of an object. 
In your test function, you add an argument with the name of the fixture, then at runtime, the pytest framework injects that fixture into your test.

e.g. you can use the client from below in any test you wish, by simply supplying an arg called client to the test function:
def test_example(client):
    # here you now have access to the FlaskClient from below. You can then use it to test the backend:
    response = client.get('localhost')

    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json == ...
"""

"""This fixture provides a flask test client. Currently, a new (clean) client is generated for each test function. 
This can be changed using the 'scope' keyword arg to the fixture.
